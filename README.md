# HEARsay Mysteries: The Commons' Comma

**Play online: https://holytispoon.github.io/HEARsay-Mysteries-Commons-Comma/**

A short investigative game about conversational receptiveness. You interview eight student witnesses on a university campus, and you get the most out of them by using the HEAR framework (**H**edge your claims, **E**mphasize agreement, **A**cknowledge the other perspective, **R**eframe to the positive), which comes from Julia Minson's research on conversational receptiveness.

The game is built in [Twine 2](https://twinery.org) with the [SugarCube 2](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/) story format.

## Play

- **Online:** open the GitHub Pages link for this repository.
- **Offline:** download the repository (Code → Download ZIP), unzip it, and open `index.html` in a web browser. Keep `index.html` and the `assets` folder together; the images are loaded from `assets/`.

A game takes about 45 to 75 minutes. Progress can be saved from the sidebar (Saves). Saves are kept in the browser you're playing in.

## What's in this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The compiled game. This is the only file a player needs, along with `assets/`. |
| `assets/` | Witness portraits and the campus map. |
| `engine/hearsay_engine.twee` | The generic game engine: SugarCube passages, JavaScript and CSS. It is the same for every scenario and holds no player-facing text. |
| `engine/HEARsay game text.xlsx` | The game's own text (rules, HEAR guide, headings, buttons), filed under the framework's passage names, and the framework's numbers (8 witnesses, 20 Clues, the question budget …). The same for every scenario. |
| `engine/build_twine.py` | Build script: runs the checks below, adds the scenario and the game text to the engine, and compiles `index.html` with Tweego. |
| `engine/game_text.py`, `engine/check_framework.py` | Read the game text, and check it against an export of the framework document. |
| `engine/scenario_matrix.py` | Reads the Response Matrix and checks the framework's rules (tripwires, clue counts, receptiveness ranks) and that the workbook agrees with itself. |
| `engine/check_packet.py` | Checks that the scenario packet says the same things as the Response Matrix. |
| `scenario/The Commons' Comma – Response Matrix.xlsx` | The scenario the game is built from: the scenario's text for each passage (the Hook, the endings …), the mystery, the final-answer form, witnesses, questions, every answer, Clues, Major Clues, Red Herrings and follow-ups. |
| `scenario/The Commons' Comma – Scenario Packet.docx` | The designer's scenario packet: the same scenario written up for people, plus the timeline, the positions and the hidden payoff. Spoilers throughout. |
| `source/story.twee` | The generated Twee source that `index.html` is compiled from. You can import it into Twine to inspect the passages. |

## Rebuild after editing the scenario

Edit the Response Matrix and make the same change in the packet, then rebuild. To change the game's own text, edit `engine/HEARsay game text.xlsx`.

Requirements: Python 3.8+ with `openpyxl` and `python-docx` (`pip3 install openpyxl python-docx`; add `pypdf` to read a PDF export of the framework), and [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) 2.1+ (it ships with SugarCube 2). Put `tweego` on your PATH, or set `TWEEGO=/path/to/tweego`.

From the repository root:

```
python3 engine/build_twine.py "scenario/The Commons' Comma – Response Matrix.xlsx" --assets assets --out .
```

The build stops if the matrix breaks a rule or disagrees with itself, or if the packet disagrees with the matrix, and it lists each problem. The game text is also checked against the framework document when an export of it is available (pass `--framework "HEARsay mysteries.docx"`); the framework is not part of this repository, so here that check is skipped with a warning. Open `index.html` to test, then commit.

## Make a new scenario

Copy the Response Matrix and the packet, replace the content while keeping the same sheets and columns, put a new `IFID` (any UUID, uppercase) on the Settings sheet, add the new portraits and map to an assets folder, and build into a new folder or repository. You don't need to change the engine.
